    "Camera calibration and point reconstruction based on direct linear transformation (DLT).\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental problem here is to find a mathematical relationship between the \n",
    " coordinates  of a 3D point and its projection onto the image plane. The DLT \n",
    " (a linear apporximation to this problem) is derived from modelling the object \n",
    " and its projection on the image plane as a pinhole camera situation.\n",
    "In simplistic terms, using the pinhole camera model, it can be found by similar \n",
    " triangles the following relation between the image coordinates (u,v) and the 3D \n",
    " point (X,Y,Z):\n",
    "   [ u ]   [ L1  L2  L3  L4 ] [ X ]\n",
    "   [ v ] = [ L5  L6  L7  L8 ] [ Y ]\n",
    "   [ 1 ]   [ L9 L10 L11 L12 ] [ Z ]\n",
    "                              [ 1 ]\n",
    "The matrix L is kwnown as the camera matrix or camera projection matrix. For a \n",
    " 2D point (X,Y), the last column of the matrix doesn't exist. In fact, the L12 \n",
    " term (or L9 for 2D DLT) is not independent from the other parameters and then \n",
    " there are only 11 (or 8 for 2D DLT) independent parameters in the DLT to be \n",
    " determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "DLT is typically used in two steps: 1. camera calibration and 2. object (point) \n",
    " reconstruction.\n",
    "The camera calibration step consists in digitizing points with known coordiantes \n",
    " in the real space.\n",
    "At least 4 points are necessary for the calibration of a plane (2D DLT) and at \n",
    " least 6 points for the calibration of a volume (3D DLT). For the 2D DLT, at least\n",
    " one view of the object (points) must be entered. For the 3D DLT, at least 2 \n",
    " different views of the object (points) must be entered.\n",
    "These coordinates (from the object and image(s)) are inputed to the DLTcalib \n",
    " algorithm which  estimates the camera parameters (8 for 2D DLT and 11 for 3D DLT).\n",
    "With these camera parameters and with the camera(s) at the same position of the \n",
    " calibration step,  we now can reconstruct the real position of any point inside \n",
    " the calibrated space (area for 2D DLT and volume for the 3D DLT) from the point \n",
    " position(s) viewed by the same fixed camera(s). \n",
    "\n",
    "This code can perform 2D or 3D DLT with any number of views (cameras).\n",
    "For 3D DLT, at least two views (cameras) are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more accurate (but more complex) algorithms for camera calibration that\n",
    " also consider lens distortion. For example, OpenCV and Tsai softwares have been\n",
    " ported to Python. However, DLT is classic, simple, and effective (fast) for \n",
    " most applications.\n",
